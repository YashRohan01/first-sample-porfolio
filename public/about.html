<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi all! This is my forst sample website that i have hosted through git hub, if any more suh porfolio repsitories are there on my profile then it means that they are wayyyy better than this basic html website.
All of the ideas and images of this website has been provided to me by the udemy course and I hope its working for me.</p>

<p>I basically do ML but not knowing basics of this part of academia always erked me so here i am, trying to do as much as i can to be marklet ready. I am very interested in ML and all the math behind it. I have implemented 
most things rom scratch and I think that i have a pretty good understanding of ML concepts. But being completely unaware of web dev called me towards it, so I'm trying to be more of a generalist! </p>

<p>Hope to become succesfull and earn money!!!!</p>
